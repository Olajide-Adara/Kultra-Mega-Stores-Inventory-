# KMS Sales Performance Analysis 

## 1. Project Overview & Business Problem

**Kultra Mega Stores (KMS)**, a leading retailer of office supplies and furniture in Lagos, is looking to enhance its business intelligence capabilities, particularly for its Abuja division. As a newly engaged Business Intelligence Analyst, my task was to analyze historical order data from **2009 to 2012** (provided in an Excel file) to uncover key sales insights and findings.

This report addresses a series of critical business questions posed by the Business Manager, aiming to provide actionable intelligence for strategic decision-making, revenue optimization, and improved operational efficiency within the Abuja division.

**Key Objectives:**
* Identify top-performing and underperforming product categories and regions.
* Analyze customer behavior across different segments (Consumers, Small Businesses, Corporate).
* Evaluate shipping cost effectiveness against order priority.
* Provide data-driven recommendations to increase revenue and profitability.

## 2. Technical Approach & Tools

The project followed a standard Business Intelligence workflow:

1.  **Data Ingestion & Preparation:** The raw Excel order data was imported into a SQL Server database. Initial data cleaning and transformation were performed using SQL to ensure data quality and readiness for modeling.
2.  **SQL Querying & View Creation:** Advanced SQL skills were applied to write complex queries and create SQL Views. These views pre-calculated key metrics and aggregated data to answer specific business questions efficiently.


**Tools Used:**
* **Database Management System:** Microsoft SQL Server
* **Database Interaction & ETL:** SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), 
* **Documentation & Version Control:** GitHub (`README.md`)
